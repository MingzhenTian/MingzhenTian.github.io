<p>原文链接： <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6513/eaay3302">Coupling of NMDA receptors and TRPM4 guides discovery of unconventional neuroprotectants</a> </p>
<p>This article recommended by Professor is about a novel mechanism of toxic NMDAR signaling. In this paper, the authors found that excitotoxicity is caused by the physical coupling of NMDAR to TRPM4 extrasynaptically, and application of reciprocal interface inhibitors can disrupt the binding of both, thereby alleviating toxicity and maintaining normal physiological function of NMDAR. These findings offer the opportunity to alleviate the symptoms of currently incurable human neurodegenerative diseases. Below I will present the background and specific findings of the study and my reflections.</p>
<p>Recent studies have found that NMRADs (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors) underlie the physiology and pathology of the human central nervous system. On the one hand, NMDARs regulate synaptic plasticity and initiate essential transcriptional responses in the nervous system. However, on the other hand, NMDARs can shut down transcriptional channels, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and even causing cell death, exhibiting a harmful side to neurons. How NMDARs exhibit both sides, especially the molecular mechanisms of cytotoxic signaling, remains unclear. The authors conjecture that the toxicity of NMDARs arises from physical interactions with other proteins and that these proteins are located extrasynaptically. Based on this, they have launched a related exploration.</p>
<p>The authors first narrowed down the interacting proteins to TRP (transient receptor potential), especially TRPM (melastatin), associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, TRPM4 has been suggested to be a key factor in the NMDAR death complex. The authors used shRNAs to knock down TRPM4 in hippocampal neurons and found that NMDA-mediated cytotoxicity was reduced. Then the authors did coimmunoprecipitation and found that TRPM4 cross-linked with NMDAR subunits GluN2A and GluN2B.</p>

<p>[^Fig1]: TwinF protects against NMDAR-mediated toxicity</p>
<p>Based on the authors’ previous conjecture, they suggested that destroying the crosslink between NMDAR and TRPM4 could eliminate cytotoxicity. After in-depth screening, they found that TwinF, a component of TRPM4, can remove excitotoxic cell death. The authors also validated the neuroprotective effect of TwinF in two neurodegenerative diseases, OGD and MCAO, with remarkable effects. Then the authors found that TwinF did not affect the excitatory postsynaptic currents of NMDARs by studying potentiation, suggesting that the protective effect of TwinF was not achieved by cutting off NMDARs.</p>

<p>[^Fig2]: TwinF prevents NMDA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and interacts with the I4 domain of GluN2A and GluN2B</p>
<p>To investigate the inhibition mechanism of TwinF, the authors constructed two TwinF variants: TwinF-F2A2 and TwinF-F2Y2. The authors found that TwinF-F2Y2 variants can eliminate NMDA-induced mitochondrial damage and can co-localize with GluN2A and GluN2B, whereas the TwinF-F2A2 variant had none of these effects. The authors immediately followed by screening the elements of NMDA that combined with TwinF, I4. I4 is a domain of GluN2A and GluN2B that was experimentally shown to interact with TwinF.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/03/31/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB1/3.jpg"></p>
<p>[^Fig3]: Identification of novel compounds that disrupt the NMDAR/TRPM4 interaction</p>
<p>The above findings reveal the great neuroprotective potential of TwinF in the clinic, but the feasibility of using TwinF in the clinic is low, so the authors expect to screen for small molecules that can bind to TwinF to disrupt the N/T interface. Through the computational method, the authors screened 192 candidate small molecules, of which compound 8 and compound 19 had significant effects. By immunoprecipitation, the authors demonstrated that these two small molecules could indeed break the N/T crosslink without affecting the expression levels of both. The EC50 and IC50 of the two small molecules were tested and both were found to be highly potent and safe.</p>
<p>The authors then investigated the mechanism of action of these two drugs. Compared with conventional NMDAR antagonists, C8 and C19 did not affect calcium ion signaling. Also, detection of currents using the diaphragm clamp technique demonstrated that C8 and C19 are not blockers of NMDA-induced currents. By studying the effects of C8 and C19 on the TRPM4 pathway, they found that C8 and C19 could detoxify NMDAR signaling, block the CREB closure pathway, restore ERK1/2 activation and IEG-induced expression, and improve mitochondrial function.</p>

<p>[^Fig5]: Compound 8 and compound 19 boost downstream signaling responses to NMDA without affecting calcium signals</p>
<p>C8 was also shown by the authors to have neuroprotective effects in vivo. The authors used two mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases, namely ischemic stroke and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. The experimental results showed that after dosing, the levels of TRPM4, GluN2A and GluN2B levels did not change, but the N/T binding rate decreased significantly with time. There was also a significant reduction in brain damage in both diseases after administration of the drug. This indicates that C8 has great potential for clinical treatment.</p>

<p>[^Fig6]: Compound 8 protects mice from MCAO-induced brain damage and NMDA-induced retinal ganglion cell loss</p>
<p>Overall, the authors found for the first time that the excitotoxicity of NMDARs arises due to physical coupling with TRPM4 and not due to calcium ion loading. And they screened for the active ingredient TwinF and the related small molecule drugs C8 and C19. This is a new means of neuroprotection. C8 and TwinF have great potential as therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the development of additional inhibitors of the NMDAR/TRPM4 interaction interface may provide more effective and broadly applicable therapeutic tools. This study also suggests that the physical coupling between different proteins may have an important role in the nervous system.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Scientific Commentary on a Paper about Empathy</strong></p>
<p>By <em>Mingzhen Tian</em></p>

<p>原文链接：<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abe3040">Anterior cingulate inputs to nucleus accumbens control the social transfer of pain and analgesia</a></p>
<p>This article recommended by Professor Nanjie Xu is about the neural circuits in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during empathy in mice. Researchers have observed for the first time that the ACC transmits signals to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) when mice observe their companions experiencing pain and analgesia. However, ACC signals to basolateral amygdala when mice observe their companions experiencing fear. Below I will present the background knowledge of empathy and the specific findings of this article.</p>
<p>Empathy is an important part of human cognition and plays a very large role in human society, making interpersonal communication efficient. Research in recent years has revealed that predecessor behaviors similar to human empathic behavior exist in many animals, especially rodents. The ACC is thought to be an important component of the neural circuitry of empathy and has connections to many brain regions associated with emotion regulation. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these empathy-related associations remain unclear. In this study, they discovered ACC-related neural circuits using optogenetic methods.</p>
<p>The authors first investigated whether pain could be rapidly transferred to bystander (BY) mice. They placed mice experiencing pain in a cage with bystander mice and tested for relevant indicators after one hour of social contact. Pain sensation was obtained from the administration of CFA to mice. The authors found that both BY mice and CFA mice showed mechanical hypersensitivity, whereas controls did not. Moreover, CFA mice show hyperalgesia in only one hind paw, whereas BY mice show it in both hind paws, suggesting that there may be higher brain regions involved in this process. The tail immersion experiment, thermal place test also demonstrated this phenomenon. These results illustrate the rapid transfer of pain empathy.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/06/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB2/1.jpg"></p>
<p>Researchers then explored the specific mechanisms of pain empathy. To determine which brain regions play a role in pain empathy, they used the TRAP technique to detect which neurons were activated. They found that in both ACC and NAc, BY mice activated more neurons than CFA mice, so they conjectured that there was a neural circuit between ACC and NAc. Then they used AAV technology and optogenetics to discover that ACC has projections on NAc. They then used the monosynaptic rabies virus tracing method to detect ACC signaling through the synapse to NAc. These results demonstrate that the ACC-NAc pathway is activated during pain empathy.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/06/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB2/2.jpg"></p>
<p>The researchers then looked more closely at the role of the ACC-NAc circuit in pain empathy. They inhibited ACC function by injecting NpHR into ACC and activated NpHR expression during empathy, and found that empathy was diminished when ACC was inhibited. Using the same approach to inhibit ACC-NAc projections, it was also found that empathy was attenuated. They then activated ACC-NAc projections by injecting ChR2 and found that empathy time was prolonged in BY mice. These results surface that ACC-NAc projections are essential for pain empathy.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/06/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB2/3.jpg"></p>
<p>The researchers then explored the role of ACC-NAc projections for other emotional empathy such as fear. They first let BY mice experience the shock to generate memories, and then watched other mice shock to generate empathy. The degree of fear empathy in mice is detected by freezing behavior. Experimental results showed that BY mice developed fear empathy. They then inhibited ACC-NAc projections and found that fear empathy was not attenuated, but inhibition of ACC-BLA (basolateral amygdala) projections attenuated the fear empathy effect. These results suggest that ACC modulates empathy for different emotions by projecting to different brain regions.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/06/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB2/4.jpg"></p>
<p>Since strong emotions such as pain and fear have been shown to produce empathy in mice, can good emotions such as analgesia produce empathy? The authors then explored the empathic behavior of analgesia in mice. The authors injected all mice with CFA, followed by morphine, and mice that were not injected with morphine were used as BY mice (CFA-Analg-BY). The authors found that CFA-Analg-BY mice did have the production of analgesia empathy compared to controls by the Von Frey assay and thermal place test. The authors go on to explore the need for ACC-NAc in analgesic empathy. The authors found that analgesic empathy was diminished in mice when ACC or ACC-NAc projections were inhibited, suggesting that ACC-NAc projections were functional.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/06/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB2/5.jpg"></p>
<p>Overall, the study identified empathic behaviors in mice, either good or bad emotions, including pain, fear, and analgesia. The present study also found that ACC projections to different brain regions can control empathic responses. Specifically, ACC-NAc regulates pain and analgesic empathy, and ACC-BLA regulates fear empathy. Their work could contribute to our deeper understanding of the more complex mechanisms of empathy in the human brain, and could be of great help in the treatment of neurological disorders with empathy deficits.</p>
<p>The study of this article has introduced me to new areas of research in neuroscience. I learned a lot of novel experimental techniques and ideas, such as TRAP, monosynaptic neuronal tracing, which benefited me a lot.</p>

<p>By <em>Mingzhen Tian</em></p>

<p>原文链接：<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06116">Plasmacytoid dendritic cells sense self-DNA coupled with antimicrobial peptide</a> </p>
<p>This article recommended by Professor Honglin Wang is about the discovery that pDCs can sense self-DNA. The role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells is usually to sense viral and microbial DNA and release interferons. This article, however, found that in the autoimmune disease psoriasis, pDCs can sense self-DNA. They found that LL37 could bind to self-DNA and thus activate pDCs and thus TLR9. This discovery explains the important role of endogenous antimicrobial peptides and identifies a possible autoantigen for psoriasis. I will then describe the relevant background, scientific issues, and specific results.</p>
<p>Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play an important role in the immune system by expressing TLR7 and TLR9 to sense viral and microbial DNA and thus release type 1 IFN to defend against infection. Studies have shown that pDCs often fail to recognize self-DNA, except in autoimmune diseases. pDCs recognize self-DNA in autoimmune diseases thus causing abnormal expression of IFNs, which is the main causative factor. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease in which the activation of autoimmune T cells leading to abnormal proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes is the main cause. Previously, pDCs have been reported to infiltrate psoriatic skin. However, the questions of how pDCs are activated in psoriasis and whether there is an association with self-DNA remain unanswered. This article attempts to answer these qusetions.</p>
<p>The authors first wanted to determine the factors that activate pDCs to generate IFNs. They used HPLC methods to separate peripheral blood from psoriasis patients into fraction and found that fraction26 was the main component. They then used ESI-MS to identify this component as psoriasin and the antimicrobial peptide LL37. The synthetic peptides method demonstrated that only LL37 could activate pDCs, while neither psoriasin nor the LL37 variant GL37 could. They then used LL37 antibody to neutralize LL37 and found that no IFN-α was produced, indicating that only LL37 worked. RT-PCR results showed that LL37 mRNA levels were elevated in psoriatic skin, and immunohistochemistry showed that LL37 was distributed in psoriatic keratinocytes, which is where pDCs are abundant. These results all suggest that LL37 is a key factor in the activation of pDCs.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/14/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB4/1.jpg"></p>
<p>The authors then looked at the specific mechanism by which LL37 activates pDCs. Since pDCs can sense nucleic acids and the structure of LL37 has the potential to bind DNA, the authors speculate that LL37 activation of pDCs is associated with self-DNA. The authors removed DNA from the culture medium and found a decrease in IFN-α secretion, suggesting that LL37 may be associated with DNA in dead cells. In addition, elevated IFN-α expression was found by mixing human DNA with LL37, indicating that LL37 converts self-DNA into a factor that activates pDCs.</p>
<p>The mixture of LL37 and DNA was analyzed by HPLC method and it was found that LL37 could bind to DNA to form a condensed complex. In addition, atomic force microscopy also revealed the presence of prominent nodes in the mixture of LL37 and DNA, which is not present in single DNA.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/14/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB4/2.jpg"></p>
<p>They then investigated whether the LL37-DNA complex could induce TLR9. They found that IFN-α levels decreased after treatment with chloroquine, which can inhibit TLR signaling. In addition, treatment of pDCs with the TLR9 inhibitor ODN-TTAGGG reduced IFN-α levels. Furthermore, the LL37-DNA complex could increase the expression of TLR9 compared to DNA alone. All these results suggest that the LL37-DNA complex can activate pDCs through TLR9.</p>
<p>TLR9 is located intracellularly in pDCs, thus preventing pDCs from recognizing self-DNA. The authors found that the mixing of LL37 with human DNA increased the fluorescence intensity of DNA in pDCs by staining localization. In addition, confocal microscopy revealed that the LL37-DNA mixture appeared on the inner side of the membrane of pDCs. These results suggest that LL37 allows self-DNA to enter the interior of pDCs.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/14/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB4/3.jpg"></p>
<p>Previous studies found that IFN-α synthesis occurs in early endosomes and IL-6 and TNF-α secretion occurs in late endosomes. The authors found that the LL37-DNA complex induced IFN-α secretion but not IL-6 and TNF-α, speculating that LL37-DNA plays a role in early nuclear endosomes. The authors then used confocal microscopy to find that LL37 could retain self-DNA in early endosomes but not in late endosomes. This suggests that LL37 can keep TLR9 activated by retaining DNA in early nuclear endosomes, leading to continued secretion of IFN and ultimately to persistent lesions in psoriasis.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/14/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB4/4.jpg"></p>
<p>In summary, this article identifies a specific mechanism for self-DNA recognition by pDCs in psoriasis. LL37 forms a complex by binding self-DNA, translocates to pDCs intracellularly to activate TLR9, and retains DNA in early endosomes for sustained IFN secretion leading to psoriasis development. This specific mechanistic study identified LL37, a target of psoriasis, which offers the possibility of developing LL37 inhibitors for the treatment of psoriasis and also provides a reference for other autoimmune disease mechanism studies.</p>

<h3 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h3><p>第一波针对癌症的基因靶向治疗聚焦于药物基因产品，这些基因产品在特定的癌症类型中反复发生突变。然而，肿瘤的突变分析在很大程度上已经被用作一种识别新的癌症靶点的策略，而这些靶点是可以用常规方法药物治疗的。 此外，一些已知的癌症基因驱动因素由于其分子结构(不可用药的致癌基因)或由于它们导致功能丧失(肿瘤抑制基因)而尚未被直接靶向。基于合成致死的遗传概念的功能基因组筛选为发现所有这些领域的药物靶点提供了途径。虽然合成致命并不是一个新想法，但最近的进展，包括基于CRISPR的基因编辑，已经使系统地筛选合成致命药物在人类癌症中的靶点成为可能。这些方法具有广泛的潜力，可以推动下一波基因癌症靶点的发现，并最终引入大多数癌症仍然需要的有效药物。 </p>
<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>对癌症特征的简化主义观点认为，靶向致瘤驱动因素、肿瘤抑制基因丢失和癌细胞逃避免疫破坏的潜在机制是治愈所需的最低限度。</p>
<p>人类基因组计划的完成、测序技术的发展，使第一代基因靶向癌症疗法的发现成为可能。以BCR-ABL融合酪氨酸激酶为靶点的 <strong>Imatinib 伊马替尼</strong>将慢性粒细胞白血病患者的中位生存期延长至10年以上。BRAF抑制剂<strong>vemurafenib 维莫非尼</strong> ，几年后又有了dabrafenib和encorafenib，将<strong>BRAF-突变的黑色素瘤</strong>从一种无法治疗的、快速进展的恶性肿瘤转变为一种超过50%的患者有显著临床反应的疾病。还有很多成功的药物，如在乳腺癌中靶向 amplified ERBB2 的药物、在非小细胞肺癌中靶向 EGFR mutations 和 ALK translocations 的药物等。然而，我们在基因靶向癌症治疗方面取得进一步进展的能力受到两个主要问题的限制。<strong>首先</strong>，靶向治疗的效果是短效的而不是持久的，需要联合治疗方案，这是一个挑战。<strong>另外</strong>，尽管DNA测序技术已经可以发现大多数突变的致癌基因，但这些基因只是癌症基因的一小部分，其他的基因无法利用传统靶向方法。</p>
<p>由于靶向癌症治疗的热情在其局限性面前有所减弱，利用免疫系统治疗癌症的进展很迅速。在很多癌症中，比如 melanoma、 renal cell carcinoma 、 NSCLC，运用checkpoint inhibitor都起到了很好的效果，比如<strong>anti-PD1、anti-PD-L1、 CTLA4抗体</strong>。 这些重要的成功进一步抑制了人们对基因靶向治疗的热情。</p>
<p>因此，尽管靶向治疗和免疫治疗的进展以不同寻常的方式改善了许多人的癌症治疗。靶向肿瘤抑制基因缺失、识别不受基因改变影响的环境依赖驱动基因、设计下一代新组合以及探索未知的肿瘤内在免疫逃避基因等的障碍都阻碍了研究的进展。然而，<strong>合成致死的遗传原理加上基于CRISPR的功能性基因组筛选技术</strong>提供了一条前进的道路。 </p>
<p>合成致死被定义为两个基因中的任意一个单独失活对细胞活力影响不大，但两个基因功能丧失同时导致细胞死亡。在癌症中，合成致死被扩展为一对基因，其中一个因缺失或突变而失活，另一个收到药理抑制，导致癌细胞死亡，而正常细胞没有基因的改变，从而免受药物影响。</p>
<p>在这篇综述中，我们讨论了如何将合成致死率的遗传概念与基于CRISPR的功能性基因组筛选相结合，用于识别下一代有效的癌症药物和药物组合。</p>
<h3 id="Synthetic-lethality-合成致死"><a href="#Synthetic-lethality-合成致死" class="headerlink" title="Synthetic lethality 合成致死"></a>Synthetic lethality 合成致死</h3><p>合成致死的遗传概念最早于1922年在果蝇身上提出。Hartwell和随后的Kaelin提出，<strong>利用合成致死的概念可以发现癌症治疗的新靶点，合成致死对中的一个对象是带有癌症特异性突变的基因产物，第二个基因产物是药物靶点。</strong></p>
<p>最近PARP抑制剂在BRCA突变型卵巢癌中的成功，是第一个使用合成致死率来靶向肿瘤抑制基因丢失的临床例子。 这一发现的基础是PARP和BRCA1和BRCA2都是有效DNA修复的成分。这种相互作用使具有BRCA1或BRCA2突变的肿瘤细胞对PARP抑制敏感。正常细胞，至少有一个BRCA1或BRCA2的拷贝，大部分都能幸免，这限制了毒性。值得注意的是，PARP抑制剂在brca1突变型和brca2突变型卵巢癌中似乎比在具有这些突变的乳腺癌中更有效，这引起了对额外“遗传背景 genetic contex ”的考虑，这是设计功能性基因组靶标发现筛选的关键因素，稍后将讨论。</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/07/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB3/1.png"></p>
<h3 id="Many-cancer-targets-to-be-discovered"><a href="#Many-cancer-targets-to-be-discovered" class="headerlink" title="Many cancer targets to be discovered"></a>Many cancer targets to be discovered</h3><p>跨多种基因背景的大规模基因敲除研究现在被用于绘制人类癌细胞中合成的致命相互作用，首先使用了基于短发夹RNA (shRNA)的方法，最近使用了CRISPR技术，消除了基于RNAi的功能基因组筛选的许多技术障碍。</p>
<p>介绍了几个大规模筛选的项目，不细看了。</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/07/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB3/2.png"></p>
<h3 id="The-importance-of-genetic-context"><a href="#The-importance-of-genetic-context" class="headerlink" title="The importance of genetic context"></a>The importance of genetic context</h3><p>在临床试验设计和实验设计中，考虑基因背景对于避免由于异质性而导致的信号稀释是很重要的。 许多合成致死对可能依赖于环境，在特定环境中其他基因的改变改变了合成致死对的功能相互作用。我们<strong>将“遗传背景”定义为驱动突变、起源组织(组织学)和其他构成癌症亚群的功能性遗传病变</strong>。</p>
<p><strong>卵巢透明细胞癌和黑色素瘤细胞系对氧传感器EGLN1的选择性依赖</strong>的发现证明了遗传环境的重要性。EGLN1是脯氨酸羟化酶EgIN家族成员，通过羟化和VHL降解调节缺氧诱导因子1α (HIF1α)的水平。 EGLN1的药理抑制可以稳定HIF1α，降低细胞适应度，导致减少增殖和细胞死亡 。之后的研究发现ARID1A作为另外的癌症依赖。在他们的分析中，无法区分HIF1α上调和ARID1A突变的影响，因为所有依赖ENGL1的细胞系都具有HIF1α上调的特征，而且大多数都有arid1突变。ARID1A在60%的卵巢透明细胞癌中突变失活，并在其他组织学中频繁突变，但值得注意的是，阿喀琉斯项目数据集中的整体分析没有发现任何可药物化的ARID1A合成致命相互作用。Briggs等人的研究表明，EGLN1的药理抑制可以选择性地杀死ARID1A-突变的卵巢癌细胞，因此这两种异常现象的结合是导致这种依赖性的原因。有报道目前临床上用于治疗贫血的EGLN抑制剂可能对治疗卵巢透明细胞癌的女性有效。治疗效果可能在ARID1A -突变亚群中最有效，但这一假设尚未在临床试验中得到验证。  </p>
<p>最近的另一个通过分析具有特定遗传背景的细胞系发现合成致死药物靶点的例子是， <strong>DNA聚合酶θ (POLQ)在brca1 -突变型和brca2 -突变型癌症中的作用</strong>。  POLQ是一种低保真度DNA聚合酶，它参与 alternative  NHEJ，这是修复具有缺陷同源重组的肿瘤DNA双链断裂的关键途径。 在brca1突变体和brca2突变体环境中， 单独敲除 POLQ基因或与PARP抑制剂结合降低细胞存活率，但在野生型环境中则不会。</p>
<p>KRAS突变提供了背景复杂性的另一个例子:<strong>KRAS中G12C或G12A突变的细胞系和肿瘤模型对酪氨酸蛋白磷酸酶非受体11型(PTPN11)抑制剂非常敏感</strong>，这是因为致癌的G12变异体依赖于ptpn11介导的GTP负载来促进下游信号传导。 鉴于G12C和G12A突变在NSCLC中富集，但在结直肠癌和胰腺癌中罕见，可能在组织学上对PTPN11抑制的敏感性存在差异。  这些数据再次强调了在目标发现中考虑其他遗传背景的重要性，并进一步表明在某些情况下，突变亚型可能需要用于患者选择。</p>
<h3 id="Large-scale-target-discovery-approaches"><a href="#Large-scale-target-discovery-approaches" class="headerlink" title="Large-scale target discovery approaches"></a>Large-scale target discovery approaches</h3><p>如前所述，功能性基因组筛选，特别是识别合成致死基因对的成对效应的高通量loss-of-function筛选，多年来一直被设想为识别新靶标和组合的途径。然而，pre-CRISPR技术对于这些应用来说还不够强大。在发现CRISPR之前，RNAi是在哺乳动物细胞中筛查功能缺失基因的标准工具。但很快就发现RNAi缺乏高通量应用的特异性。这个问题是该技术固有的，因为shRNA和siRNA序列的延伸可以结合并下调与相关基因无关的mrna，导致在基因筛选中出现多次，很大程度上是不可避免的假阳性。相比之下，CRISPR是一种高度特异性、高效和可扩展的基因组编辑技术，显著优于基于RNAi，并可用于高通量筛选，通过多种相关方法发现新的药物靶点。近年来许多新兴的基因组工程方法在癌症靶点发现中发挥着作用。随着更多的基因工具和修饰的出现，靶点发现方法将继续得到加强。</p>

<h3 id="Targeting-tumour-suppressor-gene-loss"><a href="#Targeting-tumour-suppressor-gene-loss" class="headerlink" title="Targeting tumour suppressor gene loss"></a>Targeting tumour suppressor gene loss</h3><p>肿瘤抑制基因丢失是正常细胞发生恶性转化的中心机制，通常是通过引起或允许基因组不稳定。许多肿瘤抑制基因已经被很好地鉴定，如TP53, RB1和BRCA1，但是肿瘤抑制基因的丢失是不可用药的，因为其功能和基因本身往往丢失。识别可药物合成的合成致死对是目前针对癌症中肿瘤抑制基因功能缺失的唯一方法。著名的合成致死对是PARP inhibitor在BARC1突变中起作用。但这是假设驱动的发现，而不是筛选出来的。然而，假设驱动的合成致命DNA修复路径方法的发现，受到了7种描述良好的独特DNA修复路径和每个路径内的多个基因测试假设数量的限制。 </p>
<p>考虑到人类基因组中潜在的大量合成致命相互作用，很明显，发现额外的合成致命对符合药物发现需要功能性基因组方法。 为此，一个CRISPR库可以用来识别在细胞系panel中的合成致死“hits”，这些细胞系panel共享一个特定的肿瘤抑制基因的丢失，而这个基因与保留相关基因的野生型功能的细胞系最接近。 </p>
<h4 id="MTAP-deletion-and-PRMT5-inhibition-synthetic-lethality-beyond-PARP-inhibitors"><a href="#MTAP-deletion-and-PRMT5-inhibition-synthetic-lethality-beyond-PARP-inhibitors" class="headerlink" title="MTAP deletion and PRMT5 inhibition: synthetic lethality beyond PARP inhibitors"></a><em>MTAP deletion and PRMT5 inhibition: synthetic lethality beyond PARP inhibitors</em></h4><p>Achilles项目和 DRIVE项目发现的一个最强和最普遍的合成致命相互作用是<strong>MTAP缺失细胞中的PRMT5依赖</strong>。这种依赖性代表了合成致死的一个子类： collateral lethality 旁系致死。当与肿瘤抑制基因相邻的“passenger”基因和“driver”基因丢失时，就会发生这种情况。MTAP是passenger基因，经常与驱动细胞周期蛋白依赖性激酶抑制剂 CDKN2A 共同删除。几个研究小组发现，MTAP缺失的癌细胞明显依赖于PRMT5(一种必需的甲基转移酶)，使这些细胞比没有MTAP缺失的细胞更容易受到PRMT5敲除的影响。这种依赖性的产生是因为MTAP缺失的细胞积累了高水平的PRMT5抑制辅因子MTA。因此，在MTAP缺失的细胞中，PRMT5在基线时被部分抑制，并且它们对进一步降低PRMT5活性非常敏感。这种依赖性为MTAP缺失的肿瘤患者提供了一个大的PRMT5抑制剂治疗窗口，考虑到正常细胞(没有MTAP缺失)很大程度上可以幸免，所以毒性还可以受到限制。</p>
