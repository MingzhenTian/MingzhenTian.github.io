<p>This article recommended by Professor is about a novel mechanism of toxic NMDAR signaling. In this paper, the authors found that excitotoxicity is caused by the physical coupling of NMDAR to TRPM4 extrasynaptically, and application of reciprocal interface inhibitors can disrupt the binding of both, thereby alleviating toxicity and maintaining normal physiological function of NMDAR. These findings offer the opportunity to alleviate the symptoms of currently incurable human neurodegenerative diseases. Below I will present the background and specific findings of the study and my reflections.</p>
<p>Recent studies have found that NMRADs (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors) underlie the physiology and pathology of the human central nervous system. On the one hand, NMDARs regulate synaptic plasticity and initiate essential transcriptional responses in the nervous system. However, on the other hand, NMDARs can shut down transcriptional channels, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and even causing cell death, exhibiting a harmful side to neurons. How NMDARs exhibit both sides, especially the molecular mechanisms of cytotoxic signaling, remains unclear. The authors conjecture that the toxicity of NMDARs arises from physical interactions with other proteins and that these proteins are located extrasynaptically. Based on this, they have launched a related exploration.</p>
<p>The authors first narrowed down the interacting proteins to TRP (transient receptor potential), especially TRPM (melastatin), associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, TRPM4 has been suggested to be a key factor in the NMDAR death complex. The authors used shRNAs to knock down TRPM4 in hippocampal neurons and found that NMDA-mediated cytotoxicity was reduced. Then the authors did coimmunoprecipitation and found that TRPM4 cross-linked with NMDAR subunits GluN2A and GluN2B.</p>

<p>[^Fig1]: TwinF protects against NMDAR-mediated toxicity</p>
<p>Based on the authors’ previous conjecture, they suggested that destroying the crosslink between NMDAR and TRPM4 could eliminate cytotoxicity. After in-depth screening, they found that TwinF, a component of TRPM4, can remove excitotoxic cell death. The authors also validated the neuroprotective effect of TwinF in two neurodegenerative diseases, OGD and MCAO, with remarkable effects. Then the authors found that TwinF did not affect the excitatory postsynaptic currents of NMDARs by studying potentiation, suggesting that the protective effect of TwinF was not achieved by cutting off NMDARs.</p>

<p>[^Fig2]: TwinF prevents NMDA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and interacts with the I4 domain of GluN2A and GluN2B</p>
<p>To investigate the inhibition mechanism of TwinF, the authors constructed two TwinF variants: TwinF-F2A2 and TwinF-F2Y2. The authors found that TwinF-F2Y2 variants can eliminate NMDA-induced mitochondrial damage and can co-localize with GluN2A and GluN2B, whereas the TwinF-F2A2 variant had none of these effects. The authors immediately followed by screening the elements of NMDA that combined with TwinF, I4. I4 is a domain of GluN2A and GluN2B that was experimentally shown to interact with TwinF.</p>

<p>[^Fig3]: Identification of novel compounds that disrupt the NMDAR/TRPM4 interaction</p>
<p>The above findings reveal the great neuroprotective potential of TwinF in the clinic, but the feasibility of using TwinF in the clinic is low, so the authors expect to screen for small molecules that can bind to TwinF to disrupt the N/T interface. Through the computational method, the authors screened 192 candidate small molecules, of which compound 8 and compound 19 had significant effects. By immunoprecipitation, the authors demonstrated that these two small molecules could indeed break the N/T crosslink without affecting the expression levels of both. The EC50 and IC50 of the two small molecules were tested and both were found to be highly potent and safe.</p>
<p>The authors then investigated the mechanism of action of these two drugs. Compared with conventional NMDAR antagonists, C8 and C19 did not affect calcium ion signaling. Also, detection of currents using the diaphragm clamp technique demonstrated that C8 and C19 are not blockers of NMDA-induced currents. By studying the effects of C8 and C19 on the TRPM4 pathway, they found that C8 and C19 could detoxify NMDAR signaling, block the CREB closure pathway, restore ERK1/2 activation and IEG-induced expression, and improve mitochondrial function.</p>

<p>[^Fig5]: Compound 8 and compound 19 boost downstream signaling responses to NMDA without affecting calcium signals</p>
<p>C8 was also shown by the authors to have neuroprotective effects in vivo. The authors used two mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases, namely ischemic stroke and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. The experimental results showed that after dosing, the levels of TRPM4, GluN2A and GluN2B levels did not change, but the N/T binding rate decreased significantly with time. There was also a significant reduction in brain damage in both diseases after administration of the drug. This indicates that C8 has great potential for clinical treatment.</p>

<p>[^Fig6]: Compound 8 protects mice from MCAO-induced brain damage and NMDA-induced retinal ganglion cell loss</p>
<p>Overall, the authors found for the first time that the excitotoxicity of NMDARs arises due to physical coupling with TRPM4 and not due to calcium ion loading. And they screened for the active ingredient TwinF and the related small molecule drugs C8 and C19. This is a new means of neuroprotection. C8 and TwinF have great potential as therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the development of additional inhibitors of the NMDAR/TRPM4 interaction interface may provide more effective and broadly applicable therapeutic tools. This study also suggests that the physical coupling between different proteins may have an important role in the nervous system.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Scientific Commentary on a Paper about Empathy</strong></p>

<p>原文链接：<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abe3040">Anterior cingulate inputs to nucleus accumbens control the social transfer of pain and analgesia</a></p>
<p>This article recommended by Professor Nanjie Xu is about the neural circuits in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during empathy in mice. Researchers have observed for the first time that the ACC transmits signals to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) when mice observe their companions experiencing pain and analgesia. However, ACC signals to basolateral amygdala when mice observe their companions experiencing fear. Below I will present the background knowledge of empathy and the specific findings of this article.</p>
<p>Empathy is an important part of human cognition and plays a very large role in human society, making interpersonal communication efficient. Research in recent years has revealed that predecessor behaviors similar to human empathic behavior exist in many animals, especially rodents. The ACC is thought to be an important component of the neural circuitry of empathy and has connections to many brain regions associated with emotion regulation. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these empathy-related associations remain unclear. In this study, they discovered ACC-related neural circuits using optogenetic methods.</p>
<p>The authors first investigated whether pain could be rapidly transferred to bystander (BY) mice. They placed mice experiencing pain in a cage with bystander mice and tested for relevant indicators after one hour of social contact. Pain sensation was obtained from the administration of CFA to mice. The authors found that both BY mice and CFA mice showed mechanical hypersensitivity, whereas controls did not. Moreover, CFA mice show hyperalgesia in only one hind paw, whereas BY mice show it in both hind paws, suggesting that there may be higher brain regions involved in this process. The tail immersion experiment, thermal place test also demonstrated this phenomenon. These results illustrate the rapid transfer of pain empathy.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/06/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB2/1.jpg"></p>
<p>Researchers then explored the specific mechanisms of pain empathy. To determine which brain regions play a role in pain empathy, they used the TRAP technique to detect which neurons were activated. They found that in both ACC and NAc, BY mice activated more neurons than CFA mice, so they conjectured that there was a neural circuit between ACC and NAc. Then they used AAV technology and optogenetics to discover that ACC has projections on NAc. They then used the monosynaptic rabies virus tracing method to detect ACC signaling through the synapse to NAc. These results demonstrate that the ACC-NAc pathway is activated during pain empathy.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/06/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB2/2.jpg"></p>
<p>The researchers then looked more closely at the role of the ACC-NAc circuit in pain empathy. They inhibited ACC function by injecting NpHR into ACC and activated NpHR expression during empathy, and found that empathy was diminished when ACC was inhibited. Using the same approach to inhibit ACC-NAc projections, it was also found that empathy was attenuated. They then activated ACC-NAc projections by injecting ChR2 and found that empathy time was prolonged in BY mice. These results surface that ACC-NAc projections are essential for pain empathy.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/06/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB2/3.jpg"></p>
<p>The researchers then explored the role of ACC-NAc projections for other emotional empathy such as fear. They first let BY mice experience the shock to generate memories, and then watched other mice shock to generate empathy. The degree of fear empathy in mice is detected by freezing behavior. Experimental results showed that BY mice developed fear empathy. They then inhibited ACC-NAc projections and found that fear empathy was not attenuated, but inhibition of ACC-BLA (basolateral amygdala) projections attenuated the fear empathy effect. These results suggest that ACC modulates empathy for different emotions by projecting to different brain regions.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/06/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB2/4.jpg"></p>
<p>Since strong emotions such as pain and fear have been shown to produce empathy in mice, can good emotions such as analgesia produce empathy? The authors then explored the empathic behavior of analgesia in mice. The authors injected all mice with CFA, followed by morphine, and mice that were not injected with morphine were used as BY mice (CFA-Analg-BY). The authors found that CFA-Analg-BY mice did have the production of analgesia empathy compared to controls by the Von Frey assay and thermal place test. The authors go on to explore the need for ACC-NAc in analgesic empathy. The authors found that analgesic empathy was diminished in mice when ACC or ACC-NAc projections were inhibited, suggesting that ACC-NAc projections were functional.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/04/06/%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AF%BC%E8%AF%BB2/5.jpg"></p>
<p>Overall, the study identified empathic behaviors in mice, either good or bad emotions, including pain, fear, and analgesia. The present study also found that ACC projections to different brain regions can control empathic responses. Specifically, ACC-NAc regulates pain and analgesic empathy, and ACC-BLA regulates fear empathy. Their work could contribute to our deeper understanding of the more complex mechanisms of empathy in the human brain, and could be of great help in the treatment of neurological disorders with empathy deficits.</p>
<p>The study of this article has introduced me to new areas of research in neuroscience. I learned a lot of novel experimental techniques and ideas, such as TRAP, monosynaptic neuronal tracing, which benefited me a lot.</p>
